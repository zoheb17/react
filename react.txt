what is react?
react is  A JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY 

used to build user interfaces 
especially single-page applications (spAs)


why react exists 

traditional js :
manullay update dom 
messy event handling 
haed to scale 

react 
ui is broken into components 
ui updates automatically when data changes 
much easire to reason about  complex apps 



history of reacts 
origins invetion (2011-2013)
2011-created at facebook by jordan walke 
2012- used internally in facebook news feed

virtual dom 

. A lightweight  javascript object representing  the ui 
.stored in memory as javascript object 
. very fast to update 
.used with react (react .create elements or jsx )
what is it a virtual copy of real dom kept in memory 


{
    type:"h1"
    props:{
        childern:"hello world"
    }
}


features  virtual DOM     real DOM  

speed          fast           slow 

storage        in memory       browser 

updates        smart diffing   full re--render 


manipulation   react logic browser api 


library vs framework 

library - like your toy box 
you used only what you want 
you controll the flow 

examples :reacts loadash jquery axios 


framework -like lego instruction 

structure is defined 
you follows the rules 
example angular express django 

what is a cdn ?
CDN= content delivery network 
network of global servers that deliver content faster 


benifits 

.faster load times 

reduced  server load 

better  availability 


what  is react called "React"

Reacts to data changes updating  ui efficently using virtual dom 


differencerce between react  and ReactDOM 

.React = core logic (components hooks state )

.ReactDOM=connects React with actual dom  


react. development.js react.production.js 


react development.js vs react.production.js

file            purpose         minified       warnings 
development     Dev mode          no             yes 
production        live mode       yes             no 


remember elements is an object not html 
react only runs inside the root elemrnts 


JSX ---------------------

Eeact.createElements is verbose 
.JSX makes  code easier to write and understand 


const heading =<h1> hello from react </h1>


bundlers yours shipping department 


a bundler takes all your sorce  assest & output an optimised bundle that browsers can download 


typical pipeline 

1.read every import / require 

2 transpile (JSX->js,TS-> js,etc )

concatenate /code-split 
mimify & tree -shake unsed code 
generqate hashed filename for long -terms caching 

serve with hmr hot module replacement ) during  development


popular option for  React 

bundler                   higlights 
webpack                  the most flexible & battle-tested .large plugin ecosystem 

vite                     next-gen instant dev server via natice es modules  uses  rollup for production . recomended now that create react application 
parcel                   zero-config smart defaults blazing builds  thanks to a c++ core greate for brginners 


dependencies  vs dev dependencies 


purpose                            install command                       stored 

runtime/production code              npm install axios                  dependencies 
tooling need only while developing   npm install - eslint               devDependencies 


remove any packages 

npm uninstall <package-name> 



5.version ranges ^ versus ~ 


symbol           allows updates              example  "react ":17.0.1 allows 


^caret           minor  and patch version     17.0.2,  ....but not 18.0.0
~tilde           patch version only           17.0.2 17.0.9...but not 17.1.0
